# docker-wordpress-cli
WordPress Docker image bundled with MySQL and WordPress CLI. Installs an automatically configured and ready to use WordPress.

Everything needed to run WordPress is included in the image and no manual configuration is needed. This image is perfect for (automated) testing and development.

The MySQL database is accessible from the host. 

## How to use it
1. Run WordPress

    ```
    docker run --name my-wordpress -p 80:80 -d kaihofstetter/wordpress-cli
    ```
2. Access WordPress

    ```
    http://localhost
    ```

2. Log in to WordPress

    ```
    http://localhost/wp-login.php
    ```

    Username: 'admin_user'
    
    Password: 'secret'

### Changing the WordPress port
If you don't want to use the default port 80 on the host to access WordPress, besides changing the Docker port mapping (e.g. '...-p 8080:80...'), you also need to change the configured WordPress site URL by setting the WP_URL environment variable (e.g. '...WP_URL="localhost:8080"...').

WordPress needs to know the site URL used by the host, because WordPress redirects to the site URL and uses links to the site URL. 

1. Run WordPress

    ```
    docker run --name my-wordpress -p 8080:80 -e WP_URL="localhost:8080" -d kaihofstetter/wordpress-cli
    ```
2. Access WordPress

    ```
    http://localhost:8080
    ```


### Accessing the MySQL database
Run WordPress with mapped MySQL port 3306:

```
docker run --name my-wordpress -p 80:80 -p 3306:3306 -d kaihofstetter/wordpress-cli
```

The MySQL database is accessible via ```port 3306```, ```user: WordPress``` and ```password: secret```.

### Executing WP CLI commands
The included WordPress command line interpreter (WP CLI) can be executed via ```docker exec```:

``` 
docker exec -i -t my-wordpress sudo -E -u www-data wp --path="/var/www/html" ...
```
For example:
``` 
docker exec -i -t my-wordpress sudo -E -u www-data wp --path="/var/www/html" core version
```
